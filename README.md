Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) enable quantum reinforcement learning by mapping classical states to action probabilities via trainable gates. Leveraging quantum architectures like the Hardware-Efficient Ansatz, data re-uploading techniques, and variational layers, PQCs act as universal function approximators—similar to classical neural networks—but rely on circuit depth rather than layer width to achieve expressivity.

However, existing quantum machine learning libraries often cater to experienced quantum researchers with workflows that differ from those used in classical machine learning. This makes it difficult to explore new ideas or develop initial proofs of concept without a substantial investment in learning new tools.

To bridge this gap, this project introduces a PyTorch-like framework for PQC design. The included `demo.ipynb` notebook demonstrates how PQCs can be easily built, trained, and evaluated in the CartPole-v1 environment.

Accompanying these tools is a theoretical primer (`report.pdf`) that introduces the relevant concepts from both quantum computing (parameterized gates, the parameter-shift rule, circuit ansatz) and reinforcement learning (policy selection, policy gradient estimation) needed to implement REINFORCE as a variational quantum algorithm. The project uses PennyLane to simulate quantum hardware and PyTorch for gradient-based training.
